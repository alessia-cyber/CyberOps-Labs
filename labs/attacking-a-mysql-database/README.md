## Lab - Attacking a MySQL Database

## Objective:
Understand how SQL injection vulnerabilities can be exploited and how to monitor traffic using Wireshark.

## Steps Taken:
1. Opened the PCAP file in Wireshark;  
2. Observed the IP addresses involved in the communication;  
3. Followed HTTP streams to analyze how input was processed;  
4. Examined other packets to identify patterns and interactions;  
5. Noted the database name and user from the captured traffic;  
6. Observed queries to understand how data was handled;  
7. Analyzed password hashes to learn how sensitive information can appear in traffic.

## Skills Practiced:
- Network traffic analysis with Wireshark;
- Recognizing suspicious patterns in network communications;
- Understanding database security and potential vulnerabilities.

## Lessons Learned:
- Applications that do not properly handle input can expose sensitive data; 
- Awareness of attack patterns helps improve detection and mitigation strategies.
