# Lab: Snort and Firewall Rules

## Objective

Practice monitoring and responding to malicious traffic using Snort IDS and firewall rules in a virtual cybersecurity environment.

## Steps Taken

1. Set up the CyberOps Workstation VM and verified network connectivity.
2. Ran a virtual network simulation and monitored traffic with Snort IDS.
3. Simulated malicious activity and observed alerts.
4. Tuned firewall rules to block malicious traffic and verified effectiveness.
5. Safely terminated the virtual network processes.

## Skills Practiced

- IDS monitoring and alert interpretation.
- Basic firewall rule configuration and tuning.
 -Analyzing traffic flow in a virtual environment.
- Incident detection and response workflow understanding.

## Lessons Learned

- Detection is only effective when paired with response actions.
- Virtual labs provide a safe environment to experiment with malware and network defense.
- Logging, monitoring, and proactive rule tuning are key SOC skills.
