# Lab: Logging from Multiple Sources

## Objective

Explore how centralized logging and monitoring works in a simulated network environment by using Syslog, AAA, and NetFlow.
The focus was on understanding how different sources generate security data and how this information can be collected for analysis.

## Steps Taken

1. Enabled a Syslog service to capture messages from multiple devices.
2. Observed how debug-level routing protocol messages were logged centrally.
3. Monitored user authentication and logout events using AAA/TACACS+.
4. Generated traffic and verified it was recorded by a NetFlow system.

## Skills Practiced

- Interpreting log data: timestamps, severity levels, and event details.
- Understanding authentication logging and accountability.
- Analyzing network traffic patterns through flow data.
- Connecting how these individual tools fit into a SOC workflow.

## Lessons Learned

- Each logging/monitoring tool provides value but in isolation.
- Effective monitoring requires both capturing events and analyzing them.
- Logging, monitoring, and correlation are essential skills for security operations.
